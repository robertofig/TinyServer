//
// Framework for building server applications. The building blocks of the
// code are platform-agnostic, thread-safe, and are made simple so that
// programmers can add server capabilities quickly to existing applications,
// or building new ones without being hoggled by the server part.
//
// The blueprint for building with it is to call InitServer(), then use the
// functions on the "Setup" section to prepare listening sockets and create
// IO threads. The IO is performed with the "Socket IO" group of functions,
// and IO events are captured with the "Async events" section.
