#ifndef TINYSERVER_H
//===========================================================================
// tinyserver.h
//
// Framework for building server applications. The building blocks of the
// code are platform-agnostic, thread-safe, and are made simple so that
// programmers can add server capabilities quickly to existing applications,
// or building new ones without being hoggled by the server part.
//
// The blueprint for building with it is:
//   1) Call InitServer().
//   2) Call AddListeningSocket() for each protocol and port to listen on.
//   3) Create at least one IO thread with an io loop.
//   4) Start a listening loop (can be on the main process thread, or a
//      thread specifically for it).
//
// The listening loop:
//   1) Call ListenForConnections().
//   2) Create a new ts_io object upon connection established.
//   3) Call AcceptConn() with the returned ts_listen object and the created
//      ts_io object. The result will be posted to the IO thread.
//   4) Repeat from step #1.
//
// The io loop:
//   1) Call WaitOnIoQueue().
//   2) Check the received ts_io object for connection status [.Status].
//      If the status is Status_Aborted, call DisconnectSocket; if it is
//      Status_Error, call TerminateConn. The ts_io object can be reused
//      for further AcceptConn calls.
//   3) If Status_Connected, perform RecvData, SendData, or SendFile. Each
//      operation will be posted again to WaitOnIoQueue, and may or may
//      not complete upon dequeue. Check [.BytesReceived] how much IO was
//      performed; adjust [.IoBuffer] and [.IoSize] to post again if needed.
//   4) Repeat from #1.
